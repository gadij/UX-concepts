# UX Concepts
    Create a pizza ordering app in order to demonstrate good UX design vs. bad UX design.
    This only supports small display

## Previous branch: 
    User had to login to the app, and chose his usual pizza order every time from scratch,
    dough, toppings etc.

## This branch: 
    step_7-one_click_order branch,
    after user logged in to the app, 
    the app askes the user if he wants to order his usual order,
    it takes into consideration that the user ordered the same order many times, 
    thereby this is his favorite order.
    
## Design impact: 
    The idea is very simple, as a user I want to do as much less as possible,
    and I dont want to give any unnecessary information about me.
    If I already agreed to provide info about myself, and logged in to a pizza ordering app,
    I expect the app to know me (obviously after log in), to know where do I usualy order to (my address),
    and more importantly, my usual order,
    it really raises the stress level and decrease the patience level of the user when he has to do manual,
    repetitive steps over and over, for the same result, getting the same pizza,
    this is solved by profiling and saving the most common orders of the user,
    once he is logged in, this data is pulled and suggested to him, 
    he is able to order his pizza with 2 clicks, instead of going through all the process again and again.

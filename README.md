# UX Principles
    Create a pizza ordering app in order to demonstrate good UX Desing vs. bad UX design.
    this only supports small display

## Previous branch: 
    All toppings presented in a list of texts to choose from.

## This branch: 
    step_5-change_toping_selection_from_text_to_visual_images branch is different approach,
    We are all aware of the old saying, picture`s worth a thousand words (* Frederick R. Barnard),
    this branch uses a more visual tools to catch the eye of the user, 
    instead of a boring list of topping names, 
    a more nice and elegant way of presenting the toppings.

## Design impact: 
    Back in the early days when we climbed trees and gather or hunt for food, 
    we did not have a verbal communitaion tools, well not as developed as a graphic and visual tools, 
    its was more clear to transfer a message of: "there is a pack of deers near the lake", 
    or "dont go there, there are lions near by", simply by drawing rather than explaning.
    20,000 years have passed, we developed a pretty great and complex brain, 
    capable off doing so many complex tasks in less than a second, 
    also we developed a language to communicate, but progress is much faster than evolution, 
    thus as people we are more drawn to visual tools and content than words or text,
    because of this, the brain will react faster and more intence, 
    if it sees an image of the topping that you love:
    the feel, the texture, the smell, rather than the name of it. 
    Also Your brain processes visuals 60,000 x faster than text.

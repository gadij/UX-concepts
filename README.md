# UX Principles
    Create a pizza ordering app in order to demonstrate good UX design vs. bad UX design.
    This only supports small display

## Previous branch: 
    User had to write he`s information details, each time he logged in.

## This branch: 
    step_7-one_click_order branch,
    simply tries to prevent the user of retyping the same fields over and over when logged in,
    each time,
    
## Design impact: 
    Today users are much less patient, and tend to get annoyed very fast,
    when a user knows that he is logged in, he expect the app, to know its him, 
    since he already typed in the user name and password, if the app knows its him,
    why it demands him to insert the same info again every time he logged in,
    by remebering the info the user entered, this concept decrease the amount of time,
    the user spend in retyping everything again, and it makes him much less annoyed,
    this will prevent him to throw away the app, and move the a better one,
    one that saves him time and mental stress.

# UX Concepts
    Create a pizza ordering app in order to demonstrate good UX design vs. bad UX design.
    This only supports small display

## Previous branch: 
    All toppings presented in a list of texts to choose from.

## This branch: 
    step_5-change_toping_selection_from_text_to_visual_images branch is a different approach,
    we are all aware of the old saying, a picture is worth a thousand words (* Frederick R. Barnard),
    this branch uses a more visual tools to catch the eye of the user, 
    instead of a boring list of topping names, 
    a more nice and elegant way of presenting the toppings.

## Design impact: 
    Back in the early days when we climbed trees and gathered or hunted our food, 
    we did not have a sophisticated verbal communication abilities, 
    well not as developed as a graphic and visual tools, 
    its was clearer to communicate a message such as: "there is a pack of deers near the lake", 
    or "dont go there, there are lions near by", simply by drawing rather than explaning.
    20,000 years have passed, we developed a pretty great and complex brain, 
    capable off doing so many complex tasks in less than a second, 
    also we developed a language to communicate, 
    but human progress is much faster than nature's evolution, 
    thus as people, we are more drawn to visual tools and content than words or text,
    cause our brain has not developed much in the last 20,000 years, 
    well not as developed as our human progress,
    because of this, the brain will react faster and more intence, 
    if it sees an image of the topping that you love:
    the feel, the texture, the smell, rather than the name of it. 
    Also Your brain processes visuals cue 60,000 x faster than text.

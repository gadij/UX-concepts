#UX Concepts
    Create a pizza ordering app in order to demonstrate good UX Desing vs. bad UX design.
    this only supports small display

##Previous branch: 
    Using - retype password in order to decrease the probability of making a mistake when typing a password in the signing in to an app process.

##This branch: 
    step_4-change_sing_in_with_retype_to_reveal_password branch, takes the same concept in the sign in process as the previous branch - preventing user from making mistake in typing a password, but adding a small and significant change, instead of placeing 2 inputs and making the user to type the password twice, which can be a little bit annoying, placing only 1 input to type the password once, but adding a toggle button, to reveal and hide the password typed, this gives the user the control to hide the password from curious by standards, and when finished typing, to quick look over the password type to make sure no mistake was made.

##Design impact: 
    This concept solved 3 things:
    1) Making sure user won`t make a mistake in the typing password process.
    2) Reduce the tasks/fields the user has to do/fill from 2 fields to 1 (password can be very long, doing     it twice can be very annoying).
    3) And most important, giving the user control by supplying a button which, the user can decide to hide     the password he typed, cause there are curious by standards near him, or to reveal the password in       order to check he did not make a mistake with it.

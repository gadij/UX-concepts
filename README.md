# UX Concepts
    Create a pizza ordering app in order to demonstrate good UX design vs. bad UX design.
    this only supports small display

## Previous branch: 
    N/A

## This branch: 
    step_1-all_in_one branch is the base state, it has many bad UX principles, 
    one which is specific to this branch is a big DO NOT DO in UX design - 
    placing all user input fields, regardless of the group they are related to, in one form. 

## Design impact: 
    Research show that user scan pages first to understand,
    the time and effort that will take him to finish the task in hand, 
    thus when user sees a big, long and complex form, 
    he will feel irritated or annoyed by it,
    and will probably close the app and move to another, more friendly app.

# UX Concepts
    Create a pizza ordering app in order to demonstrate good UX design vs. bad UX design.
    This only supports small display

## Previous branch: 
    Using - retype password, 
    in order to decrease the probability of making a mistake when typing a password 
    in the signing in to an app process.

## This branch: 
    step_4-change_sing_in_with_retype_to_reveal_password branch, 
    takes the same concept in the sign in process as the previous branch - 
    preventing the user from making mistakes in typing a password, 
    but adding a small and significant change - 
    instead of placeing 2 inputs and making the user typing the same password twice, 
    which can be a little annoying, 
    placing only 1 input for typing the password only once, but adding a toggle button, 
    which enabled the user to reveal or hide the password he typed in. 
    This gives the user control to hide the password he typed from curious by standards, 
    and when he finished typing, he can click the button, 
    to quickly look over the password he typed to make sure he did not make any mistake.

## Design impact: 
    This concept solved 3 things:
    1) Making sure user won`t make a mistake in the typing password process.
    2) Reduce the tasks/fields the user has to do/fill from 2 fields to 1 
        (password can be very long, doing it twice can be very annoying).
    3) And most important, giving the user control by supplying a button which, 
        the user can decide to hide the password he typed, 
        cause there are curious by standards near him, 
        or to reveal the password in order to check he did not make a mistake with it.
